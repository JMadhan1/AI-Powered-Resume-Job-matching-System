# AI-Powered-Resume-Job-matching-System
The AI-Powered Resume & Job Matching System is an innovative platform designed to enhance the recruitment process by leveraging artificial intelligence and predictive analytics. This system aims to provide smarter, bias-free job matching while promoting sustainable career paths, aligning with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as Decent Work (SDG 8), Quality Education (SDG 4), Gender Equality (SDG 5), and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10).

How It Works
The system operates through a structured workflow that involves several key stages:

Input Stage: Job seekers can upload their resumes or LinkedIn profiles, while recruiters can submit job descriptions or role requirements. This initial step sets the foundation for the subsequent processing.
Processing Stage: The platform utilizes advanced technologies, including Python for AI/ML, JavaScript for the frontend (React.js), and SQL/NoSQL databases for data management. The system performs resume parsing and skill extraction to identify the qualifications and skills of job seekers. It also analyzes job descriptions to understand the requirements of the roles.
Matching Stage: At this stage, the AI-driven matching engine employs skill DNA mapping and gap analysis to compare the skills of job seekers with the requirements of job descriptions. This process ensures that candidates are matched with roles that best fit their qualifications, promoting bias-free hiring practices.
Output Stage: The results are displayed to both job seekers and recruiters. Job seekers receive ranked job recommendations based on their skills and experiences, while recruiters get ranked candidate shortlists that align with their job postings. This output not only enhances the efficiency of the hiring process but also ensures that opportunities are accessible to a diverse range of candidates.
Key Features
The platform's core features include:
